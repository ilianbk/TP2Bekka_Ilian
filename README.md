# TP2Bekka_Ilian

For this TP, I used the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) algorithm. I tryed to do with RSA at first but it was too complicated. The app is user friendly.
You can input any caracter with any length. The input and output label might be too small in case of a 100+ caracter but it is possible to scroll.
Next time I should do bigger labels.

Normally, the .exe file can be executed but if not, the whole project (.sln) is available.
